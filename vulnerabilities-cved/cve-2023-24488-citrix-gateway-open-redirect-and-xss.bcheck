            detail: "The post_logout_redirect_uri GET Parameter is susceptible to Open Redirection, which can be exploited for CRLF injection leading to XSS through HTTP Response Splitting. There is also a potential risk of cache poisoning if Citrix Gateway is deployed in such a configuration."
            remediation: "Affected customers of Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway are recommended to install the relevant updated versions of Citrix ADC or Citrix Gateway as soon as possible - https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX477714/citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve202324487-cve202324488"
