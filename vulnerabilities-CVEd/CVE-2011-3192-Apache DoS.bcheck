                confidence: firm
                detail: "The byterange filter in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a Range header that expresses multiple overlapping ranges, exploit called \"Apache Killer\". 
 
                    Note that it has been observed on some hosts, that PoC has been successuful for \"bytes=0-\" but not for \"bytes=0-,0-\" or more \"0-\" characters. This has most likely been an attempt for a WAF fix. However, trying the attack different on more different static files (e.g. .js, .ico, .woff2, .png, .jpg, ...) might result in a higher success rate when WAF is improperly set.

                    **If you see this issue consider disabling the BCheck so as not to perform constant DoS during scanning!**"
                remediation: "Update Apache to the latest version."
