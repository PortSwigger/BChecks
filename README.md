# BChecks

Welcome to the official BChecks repository from PortSwigger. This repo contains a collection of custom scan checks written in our BChecks language, developed by both PortSwigger and the community with ðŸ§¡

BChecks can be imported and used in both Burp Suite Professional and Burp Suite DAST. To write and test your own BChecks, we recommend using Burp Suite Professional, which includes a built-in editor with syntax highlighting and testing tools.

>ðŸ’¡ This repository only contains scan checks written in our custom BChecks language. For checks written in Java, see [custom scan checks in the Bambdas repository](https://github.com/PortSwigger/bambdas/tree/main/CustomScanChecks).
